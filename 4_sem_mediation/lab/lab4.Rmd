# Data

---

```{r, include = FALSE}
dataDir <- "../data/"
hs <- readRDS(paste0(dataDir, "holzinger_swineford.rds"))
```

We will first analyze the classic Holzinger & Swineford (1939) educational 
testing data. A full version of this dataset is distributed as the `HS` dataset 
in the **MBESS** package. We don't need any functionality from **MBESS**, 
however, so I have provided a standalone (and mildly processed) version of the 
data as [*holzinger_swineford.rds*][hs_data]. 

These data contain a number of educational test scores from 7th and 8th grade 
students in two schools. This dataset comprises `r nrow(hs)` observations of the 
following `r ncol(hs)` variables.

- `id`: Numeric ID
- `age`: Student age in years
- `sex`: Biological sex of the student
- `grade`: Grade of the student
- `school`: School at which the student was tested
- `spatial1:spatial4`: Scores on four spatial reasoning tests
- `verbal1:verbal5`: Scores on five tests of verbal ability
- `speed1:speed4`: Scores on four tests of cognitive processing speed
- `memory1:memory6`: Scores on six memory tests
- `math1:math5`: Scores on five tests of mathematical ability

In the following, we will use the test scores to define latent factors of the 
underlying ability levels.

You can access the original version of the data via the [**MBESS**][mbess] 
package, and you can access the code used to process the data [here][hs_code].

# Simple Mediation 1

---

First, we will consider a simple mediation model wherein the effect of *student 
age* on *spatial reasoning ability* is mediated by *mathematical ability*.

- We will include *student age* via the single item `age`
- We will model *spatial reasoning ability* via a latent variable measured by 
the five `spatial` items.
- We will model *mathematical ability* via a latent variable measured by the 
five `math` items.

---

##

**Draw a path diagram for the model described above.**

- Label the relevant structural paths.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(figDir, "lab4_simple_mediation1.png"))
```

---

##

**Write out the structural equations necessary to evaluate the mediation 
hypothesis described above.**

```{asis}
\[
\begin{align}
\eta_{spatial} &= b \eta_{math} + c' X_{age} + \varepsilon_2\\
\eta_{math} &= a X_{age} + \varepsilon_1
\end{align}
\]
```

---

##

**Define the model syntax for the CFA.**

- Indicated the *spatial reasoning ability* factor from the four observed spatial 
reasoning test scores.
   - `spatial1:spatial4`
- Indicated the *mathematical ability* factor from the five observed math test 
scores.
   - `math1:math5`
   
```{r}
cfaMod1 <- '
spatial =~ spatial1 + spatial2 + spatial3 + spatial4
math    =~ math1    + math2    + math3    + math4    + math5
'
```

---

##

**Estimate the CFA model on the HS data.**

- Correlate the latent factors.
- Set the scale by standardizing the latent factors.
- Do not include any mean structure.

```{r}
library(lavaan)
cfaFit1 <- cfa(cfaMod1, data = hs, std.lv = TRUE)
```

---

## 

**Summarize the fitted CFA and check the model fit.**

- Do the parameter estimates look sensible?
- Does the model fit the data well enough?

```{r}
summary(cfaFit1)
fitMeasures(cfaFit1)
```

```{asis}
The model looks good. All measurement model parameters seem reasonable, and the 
model fits the data well.
```

---

##

**Define the model syntax for the structural model.**

- Specify all paths needed to test the mediation hypothesis described above.
- Include a defined parameter to quantify the indirect effect.

```{r}
## Define only the new structural parts:
semMod1 <- '
spatial ~ b * math + c * age
math    ~ a * age

ab := a * b
'

## Add on the measurement part:
semMod1 <- paste(cfaMod1, semMod1, sep = '\n')
```

---

## {#sobel}

**Estimate the structural model.**

- Do not use bootstrapping.
- Test the significance of the indirect effect using Sobel's Z.

```{r}
semFit1 <- sem(semMod1, data = hs, std.lv = TRUE)
summary(semFit1)
```

---

##

**Interpret the results.**

a. Is the indirect effect significant according to the above test?
a. Briefly interpret the indirect effect.
a. What caveats might you place on this finding?

```{r, include = FALSE}
out <- parTable(semFit1) %>% filter(label == "ab")

z <- out %$% (est / se)
p <- pnorm(z) * 2
```

```{asis}
**Answers:**

a. Yes, the indirect effect is statistically significant (
$ab = `r round(out$est, 3)`$, 
$SE = `r round(out$se, 3)`$, 
$z = `r round(z, 3)`$, 
$p = `r round(p, 3)`$
). 
a. There is a significant, negative effect of age on spatial reasoning ability 
transmitted through mathematical ability.
a. The normality assumption underlying the Sobel test may not be appropriate. We 
should test the significance of our indirect effect using bootstrapping.
```

---

##

**Test the indirect effect using bootstrapping.**

- Rerun the structural model from \@ref(sobel) using $B = 2000$ bootstrap 
resamples.
- Test the significance of the indirect effect via the 95% bias-corrected (BC) CI.
- Is the indirect effect also significant according to the bootstrapped CI?

```{r simple_mediation1_boot, cache = TRUE}
## Estimate the model with bootstrapped standard errors:
semFit1.2 <- sem(semMod1, 
                 data      = hs, 
                 std.lv    = TRUE, 
                 se        = "boot", 
                 bootstrap = 2000)

## Get the CI for the indirect effect:
## NOTE: boot.ci.type = "bca.simple" only corrects for bias, not skewness. So, 
##       these are bias-corrected CIs, not bias-corrected and accelerated.
parameterEstimates(semFit1.2, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple") %>% 
  select(-(1:3)) %>% 
  tail(1)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
out <- parameterEstimates(semFit1.2, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple") %>% tail(1)
```

```{asis}
Yes, the 95% bootstrapped CI, (`r round(out$ci.lower, 3)`; 
`r round(out$ci.upper, 3)`), does not include zero, so we can infer a 
statistically significant indirect effect at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level.
```

---

# Simple Mediation 2

---

Next, we will consider another simple mediation model wherein the effect 
of *student age* on *spatial reasoning ability* is mediated by *verbal ability*.

---

##

**Define the model syntax for the CFA.**

- Indicated the *spatial reasoning ability* factor from the four observed spatial 
reasoning test scores.
   - `spatial1:spatial4`
- Indicated the *verbal ability* factor from the five observed verbal test 
scores.
   - `verbal1:verbal5`
   
```{r}
cfaMod2 <- '
spatial =~ spatial1 + spatial2 + spatial3 + spatial4
verbal  =~ verbal1  + verbal2  + verbal3  + verbal4  + verbal5
'
```

---

##

**Estimate the CFA model on the HS data.**

- Correlate the latent factors.
- Set the scale by standardizing the latent factors.
- Do not include any mean structure.

```{r}
cfaFit2 <- cfa(cfaMod2, data = hs, std.lv = TRUE)
```

---

## 

**Summarize the fitted CFA and check the model fit.**

- Do the parameter estimates look sensible?
- Does the model fit the data well enough?

```{r}
summary(cfaFit2)
fitMeasures(cfaFit2)
```

```{asis}
This model also looks good. All measurement model parameters seem reasonable, 
and the model fits the data well.
```

---

##

**Define the model syntax for the structural model.**

- Specify all paths needed to test the mediation hypothesis described above.
- Include a defined parameter to quantify the indirect effect.

```{r}
## Define only the new structural parts:
semMod2 <- '
spatial ~ b * verbal + c * age
verbal  ~ a * age

ab := a * b
'

## Add on the measurement part:
semMod2 <- paste(cfaMod2, semMod2, sep = '\n')
```

---

##

**Estimate the structural model.**

- Use B = 2000 bootstrap resamples to quantify the sampling variability.

```{r simple_mediation2_boot, cache = TRUE}
semFit2 <- sem(semMod2, data = hs, std.lv = TRUE, se = "boot", bootstrap = 2000)
summary(semFit2)
```

---

##

**Interpret the results.**

a. Is the indirect effect significant according to the 95% *percentile CI*?
a. Is the indirect effect significant according to the 95% *BC CI*?
a. Briefly interpret the indirect effect using the most appropriate version of 
the CI to support your conclusions.

```{r}
## Percentile CI:
parameterEstimates(semFit2, boot.ci.type = "perc") %>% 
  select(-(1:3)) %>%
  tail(1)

## BC CI:
parameterEstimates(semFit2, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple") %>% 
  select(-(1:3)) %>%
  tail(1)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
out1 <- parameterEstimates(semFit2, boot.ci.type = "perc") %>% tail(1)
out2 <- parameterEstimates(semFit2, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple") %>% tail(1)
```

```{asis}
a. Yes, the indirect effect is statistically significant according to the 
percentile CI (
$ab = `r round(out1$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{perc} = [`r round(out1$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out1$ci.upper, 3)`]$
). 
a. Yes, the indirect effect is statistically significant according to the 
BC CI (
$ab = `r round(out2$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out2$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out2$ci.upper, 3)`]$
). 
a. The 95% BC CI for the indirect effect does not contain zero, so we can infer 
a significant, negative effect of age on spatial reasoning ability transmitted 
through verbal ability.
```

---

# Parallel Multiple Mediation

---

Now, we will fit a multiple mediator model that combines the two simple mediation
models evaluated above. This model will encode a process by which the effect of 
*student age* on *spatial reasoning ability* is indirectly transmitted by 
*mathematical ability* and *verbal ability* as parallel mediators.

---

##

**Define the model syntax for the CFA.**

- Indicated the *spatial reasoning ability* factor from the four observed spatial 
reasoning test scores.
   - `spatial1:spatial4`
- Indicated the *mathematical ability* factor from the five observed math test 
scores.
   - `math1:math5`
- Indicated the *verbal ability* factor from the five observed verbal test 
scores.
   - `verbal1:verbal5`
   
```{r}
cfaMod3 <- '
spatial =~ spatial1 + spatial2 + spatial3 + spatial4
math    =~ math1    + math2    + math3    + math4    + math5
verbal  =~ verbal1  + verbal2  + verbal3  + verbal4  + verbal5
'
```

---

##

**Estimate the CFA model on the HS data.**

- Correlate the latent factors.
- Set the scale by standardizing the latent factors.
- Do not include any mean structure.

```{r}
cfaFit3 <- cfa(cfaMod3, data = hs, std.lv = TRUE)
```

---

## 

**Summarize the fitted CFA and check the model fit.**

- Do the parameter estimates look sensible?
- Does the model fit the data well enough?

```{r}
summary(cfaFit3)
fitMeasures(cfaFit3)
```

```{asis}
This model looks good, too. All measurement model parameters seem reasonable, 
and the model fits the data well.
```

---

##

**Define the model syntax for the structural model.**

- Specify all paths needed to test the multiple mediation hypothesis described 
above.
- Include defined parameters to quantify all specific indirect effects and the 
total indirect effect.

```{r}
## Define only the new structural parts:
semMod3 <- '
spatial ~ b1 * math + b2 * verbal + c * age
math    ~ a1 * age
verbal  ~ a2 * age

ab1 := a1 * b1
ab2 := a2 * b2
ie  := ab1 + ab2
'

## Add on the measurement part:
semMod3 <- paste(cfaMod3, semMod3, sep = '\n')
```

---

##

**Estimate the structural model.**

- Use B = 2000 bootstrap resamples to quantify the sampling variability.

```{r parallel_mediation_boot, cache = TRUE}
semFit3 <- sem(semMod3, data = hs, std.lv = TRUE, se = "boot", bootstrap = 2000)
summary(semFit3)
```

---

##

**Interpret the results.**

a. Is the specific indirect effect through *mathematical ability* significant 
according to the 95% BC CI?
a. Is the specific indirect effect through *verbal ability* significant 
according to the 95% BC CI?
a. Is the total indirect effect significant according to the 95% BC CI?
a. Briefly interpret the indirect effects.
a. Do these results match the results from the separate simple mediation models?
   a. If you notice any differences, why do you think these differences occur?

```{r}
parameterEstimates(semFit3, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple") %>% 
  select(-(1:3)) %>%
  tail(3)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- parameterEstimates(semFit3, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple") %>% tail(3)
out1 <- tmp[1, ]
out2 <- tmp[2, ]
out3 <- tmp[3, ]
```

```{asis}
a. Yes, the specific indirect effect through *mathematical ability* is 
statistically significant (
$ab = `r round(out1$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out1$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out1$ci.upper, 3)`]$
). 
a. No, the specific indirect effect through *verbal ability* is not statistically 
significant (
$ab = `r round(out2$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out2$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out2$ci.upper, 3)`]$
). 
a. Yes, the total indirect effect is statistically significant (
$IE = `r round(out3$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out3$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out3$ci.upper, 3)`]$
). 
a. There is a significant, negative indirect effect of age on spatial reasoning 
ability transmitted through mathematical ability, but verbal reasoning ability 
does not mediate a significant proportion of the effect of age on spatial 
reasoning ability, after controlling for mathematical ability. 
The total indirect effect of age on spatial reasoning ability transmitted through 
both mathematical ability and verbal ability is also statistically significant. 
a. Yes, verbal ability is a significant mediator in the simple mediation model, 
but it is not in the parallel mediation model. 
   a. This difference probably arises from partialling out the effect of 
   mathematical ability, which seems to be the more "important" mediator in this 
   system.

# Different Data

```{r, include = FALSE}
dataDir <- "../data/"
ea <- readRDS(paste0(dataDir, "eating_attitudes_completed.rds"))
```

We will move on to a different dataset to explore serial mediator models. 
Specifically, we will work with a slightly modified version of the *Eating 
Attitudes* data used for some example analyses in [Enders (2010)][amda]. These 
data are available as [*eating_attitudes_completed.rds*][ea_data1].

This dataset includes `r nrow(ea)` observations of the following `r ncol(ea)` 
variables. Note that the variables are listed in the order that they appear on 
the dataset.

- `id`: A numeric ID
- `eat1:eat24`: Seven indicators of a *Drive for Thinness* construct
- `eat3:eat21`: Three indicators of a *Preoccupation with Food* construct
- `bmi`: Body mass index
- `wsb`: A single item assessing *Western Standards of Beauty*
- `anx`: A single item assessing *Anxiety Level*

You can download the original data [here][ea_data0], and you can access the code 
used to process the data [here][ea_code].

# Serial Multiple Mediation

---

We will evaluate a serial multiple mediation model wherein the effect of 
*Western Standards of Beauty* on *Preoccupation with Food* is mediated by the 
sequential intermediaries *Drive for Thinness* and *Anxiety*. The causal process 
represented by our model would suggest that Western beauty standards induce a 
drive for thinness which, in turn, causes anxiety which, finally, leads to a 
preoccupation with food.

##

**Draw a path diagram for the model described above.**

- Label the relevant structural paths.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}

```

##

**Write out the structural equations necessary to evaluate the mediation 
hypothesis described above.**

```{asis}
\[
\begin{align}
\eta_{pre} &= b_1 \eta_{drive} + b_2 X_{anx} + c' X_{wsb} + \varepsilon_3\\
X_{anx} &= a_2 X_{wsb} + d \eta_{drive} + \varepsilon_2\\
\eta_{drive} &= a_1 X_{wsb} + \varepsilon_1
\end{align}
\]
```


---

##

**Define the model syntax for the CFA.**

The data only contain multi-item scales for *Drive for Thinness* and 
*Preoccupation with Food*, so we only need a two-dimensional CFA evaluating the 
measurement structure of these two factors.

- Indicated the *Drive for Thinness* factor from the seven relevant scale items.
   - `eat1`, `eat2`, `eat10`, `eat11`, `eat12`, `eat14`, `eat24`
- Indicated the *Preoccupation with Food* factor from the remaining three scale 
items.
   - `eat3`, `eat18`, `eat21`
   
```{r}
cfaMod4 <- '
drive =~ eat1 + eat2  + eat10 + eat11 + eat12 + eat14 + eat24
pre   =~ eat3 + eat18 + eat21
'
```

---

##

**Estimate the CFA model on the EA data.**

- Correlate the latent factors.
- Set the scale by standardizing the latent factors.
- Do not include any mean structure.

```{r}
cfaFit4 <- cfa(cfaMod4, data = ea, std.lv = TRUE)
```

---

## 

**Summarize the fitted CFA and check the model fit.**

- Do the parameter estimates look sensible?
- Does the model fit the data well enough?

```{r}

```

```{asis}
This model looks good. All measurement model parameters seem reasonable, and the 
model fits the data well.
```

---

##

**Define the model syntax for the structural model.**

- Specify all paths needed to test the multiple mediation hypothesis described 
above.
- Include defined parameters to quantify all specific indirect effects and the 
total indirect effect.

```{r}
## Define only the new structural parts:
semMod4 <- '
pre   ~ b1 * drive + b2 * anx + cp * wsb
anx   ~ d * drive  + a2 * wsb
drive ~ a1 * wsb

ab1 := a1 * b1
ab2 := a2 * b2
adb := a1 * d * b2

## Add on the measurement part:

##

**Interpret the results.**

a. Is the two-step specific indirect effect through *Drive for Thinness* 
significant according to the 95% BC CI?
a. Is the two-step specific indirect effect through *Anxiety* significant 
according to the 95% BC CI?
a. Is the full, three-step specific indirect effect through *Drive for Thinness* 
and *Anxiety* significant according to the 95% BC CI?
a. Is the total indirect effect significant according to the 95% BC CI?
a. Briefly interpret the indirect effects.

out1 <- tmp[1, ]
out2 <- tmp[2, ]
out3 <- tmp[3, ]
out4 <- tmp[4, ]
```

```{asis}
a. Yes, the two-step specific indirect effect through *Drive for Thinness* is 
statistically significant (
$ab = `r round(out1$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out1$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out1$ci.upper, 3)`]$
).

a. No, the two-step specific indirect effect through *anxiety* is not 
statistically significant (
$ab = `r round(out2$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out2$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out2$ci.upper, 3)`]$
).

a. Yes, the full, three-step specific indirect effect is statistically 
significant (
$adb = `r round(out3$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out3$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out3$ci.upper, 3)`]$
).

a. Yes, the total indirect effect is statistically significant (
$IE = `r round(out4$est, 3)`$, 
$95\%~CI_{BC} = [`r round(out4$ci.lower, 3)`; `r round(out4$ci.upper, 3)`]$
).

a. The hypothesized causal chain linking Western beauty standards to 
preoccupation with food through drive for thinness and anxiety was supported by 
a statistically significant specific indirect effect. Western beauty 
standards had a significant, positive effect on preoccupation with food, and 
this effect was transmitted indirectly by first increasing the drive for thinness 
which subsequently increased anxiety to, finally, increase preoccupation with 
food.

   A subprocess by which the effect of Western beauty standards on preoccupation 
   with food is transmitted indirectly through drive for thinness was also

   nonsignificant indirect effect and, hence, was not supported by these results.
