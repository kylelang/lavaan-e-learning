Today’s lab meeting consists of three exercises. Each exercise illustrates the evaluation of theory-based hypotheses in a SEM model (using the goric() function of the restriktor package). 

The exercises are based on the following article:

Kuiper, R. M. (2022). AIC-type Theory-Based Model Selection for Structural Equation Models, Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 29:1, 151-158
[https://doi-org.proxy.library.uu.nl/10.1080/10705511.2020.1836967].  
Note that the code in this article is based on an older version of restriktor.

You can find tutorials on https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/Tutorials. The 'Guidelines_output_GORIC.html' can help you with interpreting the GORICA output.  
Note: The file 'ReadMe.txt' describes how you can download files.


&nbsp;

Practical information:

- All the data files for these exercises can be found at the course platform (i.e., UU learning platform). Make sure to download and unzip the .zip file. The folder containing the data files will probably be your working directory.


Short description of exercises:

- Exercise 1 addresses theory-based hypotheses in a two-factor confirmatory factor analysis,

- Exercise 2 addresses theory-based hypotheses in a latent regression and,

- Exercise 3 addresses theory-based hypotheses in a multigroup latent regression.





# Data

The exercises below will all be applied to the same data set: A simulated data set based on the Sesame Street data (Stevens, 1996), which is included as the dataset ‘sesamsim’ in the gorica package. Thus, when you install and load the gorica package, the object sesamsim exists, which contains all the data:
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# Install and load the gorica library because it contains the data 'sesamesim'
if (!require("gorica")) install.packages("gorica") # install this package first (once)
library(gorica)
# 
# If you want to peak at the top of the data set
#head(sesamesim)
```


Since the data sets contain simulated data, there are no missing values. All the variables are numeric, which does not affect the results in these exercises since there are no grouping variables with more than two levels. We need only one grouping variable, namely sex, which consists of two levels. It can be helpful, though, to make it a factor such that labels can be assigned to the two levels:

```{r, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
sesamesim$sex <- factor(sesamesim$sex, labels = c("boy", "girl"))
```

&nbsp;

The exercises concern the effect of watching one year of the tv-series “Sesame Street” on the knowledge of numbers of N = 240 children aged between 34 and 69 months. Several variables have been measured before and after watching Sesame Street for one year: Knowledge of numbers before (Bn) and after (An) watching, and analogously, knowledge of body parts (Bb and Ab), letters (Bl and Al), forms (Bf and Af), relationships (Br and Ar), and classifications (Bc and Ac). The score ranges on these variables ranges from ‘1 to 20’ to ’1 to 70‘. In the exercises, we will use these variables as well as the following ones: biological age in months (age; score range: 34 to 69), the Peabody test measuring the mental age of children (peabody; score range: 15 to 89), and gender (sex; 1 = boy, 2 = girl).


# Exercise 1: Confirmatory Factor Analysis

In this exercise, we will inspect the two-factor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), in which the A(fter) measurements (i.e., Ab, Al, Af, An, Ar, and Ac) load on the factor A, and the B(efore) measurements load on the factor B.

## Exercise 1a 

It is a good practice to draw the model you plan to estimate for yourself. Draw the model.

You can compare your path diagram to Figure 1 in the article: https://doi-org.proxy.library.uu.nl/10.1080/10705511.2020.1836967; or compare it to one created based on the fitted object in Exercise 1d.

</details>

&nbsp;


## Exercise 1b 

Specify the two-factor CFA model (such that it can be used in the lavaan function later on).

For ease of specifying the hypotheses (which is done next), label the parameters; e.g. use for the factor Ab: A1*Ab

*Make sure* to install and load all the packages needed (i.e., lavaan, restriktor, and gorica).

&nbsp;

**Installing and loading packages**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# install this package first (once)
if (!require("restriktor")) install.packages("restriktor")
if (!require("lavaan")) install.packages("lavaan")

# Load
library(restriktor)
library(lavaan)

# Also install and load the gorica library because it contains the data 'sesamesim'
if (!require("gorica")) install.packages("gorica") # install this package first (once)
library(gorica)
```

**Specify the CFA model**

Note: the `goric` function cannot always use the default labeling, so give your own labels to estimates by including them in the `lavaan` model:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
model1 <- '
    A =~ A1*Ab + A2*Al + A3*Af + A4*An + A5*Ar + A6*Ac 
    B =~ B1*Bb + B2*Bl + B3*Bf + B4*Bn + B5*Br + B6*Bc 
'
```

</details>

&nbsp;


## Exercise 1c 

Come up with one or more hypotheses and a failsafe hypothesis.

Remarks:

* In a paper, hypotheses are specified in terms of population model parameters (often expressed as Greek letters).
* In R, hypotheses are specified in terms of the variables the parameters of interest belong to and/or the assigned labels.
* When using goric(), the restrictions need to be 'connected' by using ';', ',', or '&'; e.g., A1 > .6; A2 > .6.
* Make sure that the comparison of factor loadings or comparison of factor loadings to a pre-specified value is fair. 
  *Hint:* You probably have hypotheses w.r.t. standardized model parameters.
* In the solution below, one theory-based hypothesis is evaluated against its complement. The hypothesis states that each standardized factor loading is larger than .6, meaning that the indicators are strongly related to the factors to which they are assigned. 


<details><summary><b>Click to show answers</b></summary>

&nbsp;

**Hypothesis of interest**

In this solution, we hypothesize that the indicators are strongly related to the factors to which they are assigned. This can be reflected by stating that each standardized factor loading is larger than .6. This leads to 12 order restrictions, which should be 'connected'.

The hypothesis of interest (using our own labeling) is then formulated by:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
H1.1 <- "
A1 > .6; A2 > .6; A3 > .6; A4 > .6; A5 > .6; A6 > .6; 
B1 > .6; B2 > .6; B3 > .6; B4 > .6; B5 > .6; B6 > .6
"
```

</details>

&nbsp;


## Exercise 1d 

Run the two-factor CFA specified in 1b.


<details><summary><b>Click to show answers</b></summary>

&nbsp;

**Fit the CFA model**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
fit1 <- sem(model1, data = sesamesim, std.lv = TRUE)

# summary(fit1, standardize = T)
# fitmeasures(fit1)
```

**Plot the CFA model**
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# install this package first (once)
if (!require("lavaanPlot")) install.packages("lavaanPlot") 
library(lavaanPlot)

# plot the model
lavaanPlot(model = fit1, node_options = list(shape = "box", fontname = "Helvetica"), 
           edge_options = list(color = "grey"), coefs = T, stand = T, covs = T)
```

</details>

&nbsp;


## Exercise 1e 

Use the goric() function in the restriktor package to evaluate your hypothesis/-es of interest with the GORICA (`type = "gorica"`, which is the default when adding a lavaan fit object).

* Add the hypothesis/-es of interest as a list in the argument 'hypotheses'; e.g., goric(fit, hypotheses = list(H1)).
* In case there is one hypothesis of interest, then your failsafe or competing hypothesis is preferably its complement. Then, use: `comparison = "complement"`
* In case the hypotheses address standardized model parameters, also include the argument: `standardized = TRUE`
* Before running goric(), set a seed value (e.g., `set.seed(100)`), since the penalty (PT) is obtained via sampling. One can also do a sensitivity check by using other seed values (also done below).

*Interpret the output. What are your conclusions?*

&nbsp;

**Apply GORICA**

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(100) # since penalty (PT) is obtained via sampling.
results1 <- goric(fit1, hypotheses = list(H1.1 = H1.1), 
                  comparison = "complement", type = "gorica", 
                  standardized = TRUE) 
```

**Summary GORICA**

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
# Note: This also includes the comparison of hypotheses
#summary(results1)
results1
```

The order-restricted hypothesis ‘H1.1’ has 85.56 times more support than its complement.

**Possible conclusion**

* The R output shows that the hypothesis of interest (H1.1) has the largest fit and the smallest complexity and, thus, the smallest GORICA value and highest GORICA weight. 
* The GORICA weight for H1 (against it complement) is 0.988.
* Hence, the support in the data in favor of H1.1 is overwhelming: H1.1 is $0.988/0.012 \approx 86$ times more supported than its complement.
* Thus, there is overwhelming support for the hypothesis that each factor loading is larger than .6.

&nbsp;

**Sensitivity check**

Although the penalty (PT) calculated by the goric() seems to be very robust, it cannot harm to do a sensitivity check on the PT when you use goric(). Next, you can see that the influence of the seed on the PT values is negligible, as we would also like it to be.

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
results1$result[,3]

set.seed(100)
goric(fit1, hypotheses = list(H1.1 = H1.1), 
      comparison = "complement", type = "gorica", 
      standardized = TRUE)$result[,3]

set.seed(100100)
goric(fit1, hypotheses = list(H1.1 = H1.1), 
      comparison = "complement", type = "gorica", 
      standardized = TRUE)$result[,3]

      comparison = "complement", type = "gorica", 
      standardized = TRUE)$result[,3]
```

</details>

&nbsp;


# Exercise 2: Latent regression

In this exercise, we will inspect a latent regression model. The factors B and A have the same indicators as in Exercise 1. The difference is the addition of a latent regression in which A is regressed on B, age, and peabody, to investigate whether children’s knowledge after watching Sesame Street for a year is predicted by their knowledge one year before, as well as by their biological and mental age, which have a correlation of 
```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
cor(sesamesim$peabody, sesamesim$age)
```
($\approx .24$); so, there is no multicollinearity.

Repeat the steps in Exercise 1, but now for this model; that is:

## Exercise 2c 

Come up with one or more hypotheses and a failsafe hypothesis.


<details><summary><b>Click to show information on the hypotheses used in the answers</b></summary>

&nbsp;

In the solution, we evaluate three theory-based hypotheses (H1.2-H3.2) on standardized regression coefficients. Since these three do not cover all the possible theories, we include the unconstrained as failsafe.

* **H1.2** specifies that a larger score on B corresponds to a larger score on A (i.e., a positive relation between B and A) and that age and peabody do not predict A.

* **H2.2** specifies that the positive relation between B and A is stronger than the positive relation between peabody and A and that age cannot be used to predict A.

* **H3.2** specifies that the predictive power of B is larger than that of peabody, which, in turn, is larger than that of age which in turn is positive. 

Notably, only in case all these hypotheses are of interest, these should all be included in the set; especially if there is overlap like here (see the article: https://doi-org.proxy.library.uu.nl/10.1080/10705511.2020.1836967 and/or 'Guidelines_output_GORIC.html' on https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/Tutorials for more information).

## Exercise 2e 

Evaluate the hypotheses with the GORICA.

*Interpret the output. What are your conclusions? *


<details><summary><b>Click to show answers</b></summary>

&nbsp;

**GORICA**

In our hypotheses (as in many hypotheses not addressing mean values), we need standardized parameters for a meaningful and fair comparison. Because we have more than one hypothesis, we need to use the unconstrained as failsafe, which is the default option in goric(). This is requested via:

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(100)
results2 <- goric(fit2, hypotheses = list(H1.2 = H1.2, H2.2 = H2.2, H3.2 = H3.2), 
                  type = "gorica", standardized = TRUE)
results2
#summary(results2) # Note: This also includes the comparison of hypotheses
```

Note: In case of equal log-likelihood (loglik) values (i.e., ratio of loglik weights of 1), the ratio of GORICA weights are solely based on the difference in penalty values. See the article (https://doi-org.proxy.library.uu.nl/10.1080/10705511.2020.1836967) or the guidelines ('Guidelines_output_GORIC.html' on https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/Tutorials) for more information.

&nbsp;

**Possible conclusions**

* Since the hypotheses overlap and the most restricted one (H1.2) receives the most support (and is not weak), H1.2 is the preferred hypothesis. 
* Because the support for the other hypotheses also contain support for H1.2, one could also compare H1.2 to its complement, see below. This shows convincing support for H1.2. 
* Thus, there is support for the hypothesis that a larger score on B corresponds to a larger score on A (i.e., a positive effect) and that age and peabody do not predict A. Based on the evaluation below, this hypothesis is approximately 7 times more likely than its complement containing all competing hypotheses.

&nbsp;

**Extra: H1.2 vs its complement**

Since the hypotheses are nested, the hypotheses share support. Therefore, we also examine the best of these (i.e., H1.2) against its compliment:

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(100)
results2_c <- goric(fit2, hypotheses = list(H1.2 = H1.2), 
                    comparison = "complement", type = "gorica",
                    standardized = TRUE) 
#summary(results2_c) # Note: This also includes the comparison of hypotheses
results2_c
```

The order-restricted hypothesis ‘H1.2’ has  6.97 times more support than its complement. This is convincing support for H1.2.

# Exercise 3: Multigroup latent regression

In this exercise, we will inspect a multigroup regression model, by including the grouping variable gender (sex) in a regression model. This means that there is one regression model for girls and one for boys, where the standardized model parameter estimates may differ between girls and boys. 

In the regression, postnumb is regressed on prenumb, to investigate whether children’s knowledge of numbers after watching Sesame Street for a year is predicted by their knowledge of numbers one year before. 

Repeat the steps in Exercise 1, but now for this model; that is:

In this case, the complement states that the standardized relationship between postnumb and prenumb is lower for girls than for boys.

The hypotheses of interest is formulated as follows, using our own labeling:

## Exercise 3e 

Evaluate the hypotheses with the GORICA.

*Interpret the output. What are your conclusions? *

**GORICA**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

results3 <- goric(fit3, hypotheses = list(H1.3 =  H1.3), 
                  comparison = "complement", type = "gorica", 
                  standardized = T) 

#summary(results3) # Note: This also includes the comparison of hypotheses
results3
```


**Possible conclusions**

* The output shows that the hypothesis of interest and its complement are equally likely, since both have a GORICA weight of approximately .50. 
  That is, they have about the same support.
* Since the hypotheses do not overlap and are equally complex (i.e., have the same penalty value), this implies that their boundary is the preferred hypothesis, that is, H0: Pre_b = Pre_g.
* Thus, there is support for the boundary of the hypothesis of interest and its complement, indicating that the relationship between postnumb and prenumb is equally high for girls and boys.

## Exercise 3f - Extra

Do the same evaluation as in 3b to 3e, but now use the (standardized) estimates and their covariance matrix as input to the goric function (instead of the lavaan object). E.g., use:

`goric(est, VCOV = vcov, hypotheses = list(H1), 
       comparison = "complement", type = "gorica ")`

with `est` the (standardized) estimates and `vcov` their covariance matrix.

**Installing and loading packages**

```{r, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
# install this package first (once)
if (!require("restriktor")) install.packages("restriktor") 
# install this package first (once)
if (!require("lavaan")) install.packages("lavaan") 

library(restriktor)
library(lavaan)

# Also load the gorica library because it contains the data 'sesamesim'
# install this package first (once)
if (!require("gorica")) install.packages("gorica") 
library(gorica)
```

**Data**

Optional: Make the variable 'sex' a factor with the right labels:
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
sesamesim$sex <- factor(sesamesim$sex, labels = c("boy", "girl"))
```

**Specify the multigroup regression model**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
model3 <- '
    postnumb ~ prenumb 
'
```

**Hypothesis of interest**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
H1.3 <- "Pre_boy < Pre_girl"
```
We, again, used our own labeling, which should be the same as those used below:


**Fit the multigroup regression model**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
fit3 <- sem(model3, data = sesamesim, std.lv = TRUE, group = "sex")
```


**Plot the multigroup regression model**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# install this package first (once)
#if (!require("lavaanPlot")) install.packages("lavaanPlot")
library(lavaanPlot)

#plot 
lavaanPlot(model = fit3, node_options = list(shape = "box", fontname = "Helvetica"), edge_options = list(color = "grey"), coefs = T, stand = T, covs = T)
```

**GORICA**

Now, we will extract the estimates from the lavaan object ourselves and use that.

Obtain standardized(!) estimates from lavaan object (labelled or unlabelled) via:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
est_3 <- lavaan::standardizedsolution(fit3)[c(1,6), 'est.std']
# Note: This should be the same as the labeling used in H1.3.
names(est_3) <- c("Pre_boy", "Pre_girl") 

# Note: Use the following in the 'VCOV = ' command (i.e., 'VCOV = vcov_3').
vcov_3 <- lavInspect(fit3, "vcov.std.all")[c(1,4), c(1,4)] 
```

Now, use these when calculating the GORICA values and weights for H1.3 and its complement (`comparison = "complement"`), via:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
set.seed(100)
results3 <- goric(est_3, VCOV = vcov_3, hypotheses = list(H1.3 =  H1.3), 
                  comparison = "complement", type = "gorica") 
#summary(results3) # Note: This also includes the comparison of hypotheses
results3
```


**Possible conclusions**

The results are of course exactly the same and, consequently, the conclusions as well:

* The output shows that the hypothesis of interest and its compliment are equally likely, since both have a GORICA weight of approximately .50. That is, they have about the same support.
* Since the hypotheses do not overlap and are equally complex (i.e., have the same penalty value), this implies that their boundary is the preferred hypothesis, that is, H0: Pre_boy = Pre_girl.
* Thus, there is support for the boundary of the hypothesis of interest and its complement, indicating that the relationship between postnumb and prenumb is equally high for girls and boys.

**Sensitivity check**

Next, you find code to check the influence of the seed in calculating the penalty (PT), which is none:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
results3$result[,3]

set.seed(100)
goric(est_3, VCOV = vcov_3, hypotheses = list(H1.3 =  H1.3), 
      comparison = "complement", type = "gorica")$result[,3]

set.seed(100100)
goric(est_3, VCOV = vcov_3, hypotheses = list(H1.3 =  H1.3), 
      comparison = "complement", type = "gorica")$result[,3]

set.seed(123456)
goric(est_3, VCOV = vcov_3, hypotheses = list(H1.3 =  H1.3), 
      comparison = "complement", type = "gorica")$result[,3]
```
